# Scraper Authentication Protection Summary

## Changes Made

All scraper-related endpoints in the CardMarket backend now require user authentication. This prevents non-logged-in users from accessing any scraping functionality.

### Modified Endpoints

‚úÖ **Added `@auth_required` decorator to:**

1. `/api/scrapers/status` - Get scraper status information
2. `/api/scrapers/available` - Get list of available scrapers
3. `/api/cards/<card_id>/buy-price` - Update card buy price
4. `/api/cards/<card_id>` - Update card data

### Already Protected Endpoints

‚úÖ **These endpoints already had `@auth_required`:**

1. `/api/scrape/cards` - Scrape trading cards from CardMarket
2. `/api/cards/rescrape` - Rescrape prices for existing cards
3. `/api/cards/scrape-single` - Scrape a single card from URL
4. `/api/scrape/steam` - Scrape Steam CS2 inventory
5. `/api/steam/update-prices` - Update Steam item prices using CSGOSkins.gg
6. `/api/steam/items/<item_id>` - Update Steam inventory item

## Security Benefits

üîí **Full Protection:** Non-logged-in users can no longer:

- View scraper status or availability
- Trigger any scraping operations
- Update card or Steam item prices
- Access any price-related functionality

üõ°Ô∏è **Authentication Required:** All scraper functionality now requires:

- Valid user account and login
- JWT token in Authorization header
- Active authentication session

## Testing

‚úÖ **Verification completed:** All scraper endpoints return `401 Unauthorized` when accessed without authentication.

## Frontend Impact

üí° **No changes needed:** The frontend already uses the `apiClient` which automatically includes authentication headers from `authService.getAuthHeaders()`, so logged-in users will continue to work normally.

## Usage

- **Logged-in users:** Full access to all scraper functionality as before
- **Non-logged-in users:** No access to scraper endpoints (401 errors)
- **API testing:** Must include `Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>` header

## Performance Impact

‚ö° **CSGOSkins.gg Optimizations:** Recent performance improvements should provide:

- ~2.5 seconds average per item (down from 1+ minutes)
- Reduced delays and aggressive timeouts
- Better handling of verification challenges
- Improved caching and pattern detection
